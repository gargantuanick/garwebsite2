# Netlify Configuration for Gargantua Group Website
# This is a static HTML site with no build process

[build]
  # No build command needed - this is a static site

  # Publish the root directory (static HTML files)

# Note: Netlify's security scanner examines the entire repository
# The source_gargantua directory contains old Next.js build artifacts
# that are NOT deployed but may trigger security alerts.
# 
# To completely eliminate alerts, consider:
# 1. Adding source_gargantua/ to .gitignore (if not needed in repo)
# 2. Or removing the directory entirely
# 3. Or contacting Netlify support to exclude it from scans
